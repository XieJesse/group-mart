# GroupMart

## About  
GroupMart is a Google Chrome browser extension for the Walmart website that allows users to add individual lists with items from an order, and then quickly calculate the total cost of each cart based on the order subtotal. This makes it easy and convenient for groups of people looking to buy/pay for different items within a single order. The extension is written in JavaScript and scrapes the DOM to obtain all of the item information, displaying the calculated prices in the pop-up of the extension. 

## Use Instructions  
Download the repository, and load the unpacked extension at <chrome://extensions/>.    


After making an order with items from Walmart lists, press the "Add Lists" button on each individual list. Press the "Add Order" button in the details page for the order, and then open the pop-up page of the extension. The calculated prices for each list will be displayed in a table with the item names and the corresponding prices.
